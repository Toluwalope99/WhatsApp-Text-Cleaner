# WhatsApp-Text-Cleaner
This project takes a txt file which contains texts copied from WhatsApp with their timecodes and datecodes as well as user that sent and removes everything as well as asterisks and underscores for bold and italics respectively to make the text fully READABLE.
It receives the txt file to be in the default download folder of the system. Can be easily adjusted using file operations.
